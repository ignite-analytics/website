      <description>The big Why? Test 123456 I have to admit I am annoyed by CMS systems. All of them require constant care and are usually hard to use. In the past I have tried Wordpress or Drupal and always found that they kind of work, but once I left it alone for a couple months it got ugly. So I got rid of all these installations after a while.
Currently I only have to care for one CMS called Contao which gives me constant grief by being hard to use and requiring the usual attention.</description>
